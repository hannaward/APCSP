    <p class = "mClass"> Here is a project that I created in my AP Art this year. I learned a lot of about how to use watercolor and acrylic together and what kind of look and style this can give a project. I started off with a sketch of my image and then painting my sky and background landscape, moving then to the woman depicted at the front of the painting and the glass she is drinking from. This project took me a really long time to complete but I'm very happy with how it turned out. </p>

    <p class = "hClass"> Here is another project that I created in my AP Art this year. I learned how to effectively blend acrylic paint in order to create the look I wanted for my heart. This year I experimented with the idea that nature can be reflected through human anatomy. This concept is apparent through my use of the human heart stylized as a phonograph playing music on top of a ribcage. I had a lot of fun creating this peice because of all the creative freedom I was allowed. </p>
