    <p class="p">My name is Hanna Ward, I am 17, and I'm a junior at Piedmont High School. I live with my parents, younger brother, and 2 cats. On the weekends or in my free time I love to do art and hang out with my friends because they make me happy. We like going shopping, to the beach, to the movies, and cooking together in order to effectively take up our freetime.
